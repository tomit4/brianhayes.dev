This ./genrss utilizes rsspls and xmlstarlet to generate and format your rss feed once the html article has been generated. Simply prepend it to the feeds.toml file in ~/.config/rsspls folder. Make sure to rename the last article pushed "the_article_title.rss" and name the newest filename at the top "feed.rss" for the script to work.
